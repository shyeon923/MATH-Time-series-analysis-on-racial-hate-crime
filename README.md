# Description
Using the same research topics from my Data Analytics senior captsone project, I am implementing time-series methods to find the best predictive models for all racial hate crimes, anti-Black or African American hate crimes, and anti-Asian hate crimes.

# Software
I used *Python 3* to collect and clean data (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009). For descriptive and predictive analysis, I used R v4.1.3 (R Core Team, 2022). Packages used will be updated.
